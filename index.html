        <p>All of them had hair of gold like their mother the youngest one in curls? All of them had hair of gold like their mother the youngest one in curls? So lets make the out most of this beautiful day. Since we're together; And we'll do it our way yes our way. Make all our dreams come true for me and you. The first mate and his Skipper too will do their very best to make the others comfortable in their tropic island nest. Got kind of tired packin' and unpackin' - town to town and up and down the dial. Straightnin' the curves. Flatnin' the hills Someday the mountain might get ‘em but the law never will. Space. The final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise.</p>

        <p>If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment to interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and resting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth—off lone Fanning's Island, or the far away King's Mills; how much more natural, I say, that under such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and sociable contact. And especially would this seem to be a matter of course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose captains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to each other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about.</p>
